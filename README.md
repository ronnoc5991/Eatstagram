Hello!  Thank you for visiting this repo!

This is EATSTAGRAM!

This is a personal project that solved a problem of mine while providing me with an opportunity to tie some newly learned technologies together.


WHY DOES EATSTAGRAM EXIST?
  Eatstagram was created in order to help with my weekly menu planning.  Like most people, before I go shopping, I make a shopping list.  This shopping list is based on what I am going to eat in a week.  I often found that I was lacking inspiration when making my shopping list and had a hard time coming up with meal ideas.  I thought that it would be nice to see all of the different things that I had made before and enjoyed in one place so that I could quickly get some inspiration when I needed it.  Thus, Eatstagram.
  
WHAT DID I USE?
  Eatstagram was built with React and uses Firebase for the backend.
